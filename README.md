The first of many projects completed on The Odin Project.

This HTML recipes project focuses on creating multiple web pages locally. In each recipe, there are multiple HTML tags being used, such as anchor, img, and heading tags.

The project also focuses on remembering the importance of relative paths by incorporating src attributes in img tags where the path must be specified.
